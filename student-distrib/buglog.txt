Bug 1:
    Description of problem: Writing to the wrong port
    Difficulty to find: Hard
    Difficulty to fix: Medium
    Solution: We realized quickly that we were not writing to the correct port so we were not obtaining the correct output. We changed our OUTB and were able to get past        this issue.

Bug 2:
    Description of problem: Compilation is unable to find file
    Difficulty to find: Hard
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: We needed a capital S instead of a lowercase s in our file declaration.

Bug 3:
    Description of problem: Forgot to update global variable for master and slave picks on calls to irq
    Difficulty to find: Medium
    Difficulty to fix: Medium
    Solution: We updated the global variables so we can have the right values for master and slave picks.

Bug 4:
    Description of problem: OUTB not working correctly
    Difficulty to find: Medium
    Difficulty to fix: Medium
    Solution: Our data and address parameters were flipped, so OUTB worked after we flipped these.

Bug 5:
    Description of problem: Did not send an end of interrupt to master port 2, when interrupt came from slave
    Difficulty to find: Hard
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Add an OUTB to write EOI to the master as well as the slave for slave triggered interrupts

Bug 6:
    Description of problem: Skipping over first data block entirely, no characters on screen
    Difficulty to find: Hard
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Make sure there is no offset when runnind read data so all data block are written

Bug 7:
    Description of problem: Page fault when trying to read file
    Difficulty to find: Hard
    Difficulty to fix: Medium
    Solution: File was not properly read when checking for index, use strncmp instead of conditional statement

Bug 8:
    Description of problem: Extra character at the end of very long file name
    Difficulty to find: Medium
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Only compare first 32 bytes so no other bytes are copied into buffer

Bug 9:
    Description of problem: Skipping over characters in file when writing to screen
    Difficulty to find: Hard
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Make sure pointer to address in data block only points to 8 bits, not 32

Bug 10:
    Description of problem: File size not calculating correctly
    Difficulty to find: Hard
    Difficulty to fix: Hard
    Solution: Break up equation into steps rather than one line to avoid small errors

Bug 11:
    Description of problem: Keyboard handler not printing normal lowercase letters
    Difficulty to find: Easy
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: conditional logic was placed in the wrong order causing the case needed to
              print the lowercase letters to never be hit

Bug 12:
    Description of problem: Scrolling moved every line up except for he last line (bottom)
    Difficulty to find: Easy
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Loop over all video memory positions correlated to the bottom row and clear them (set to 0)

Bug 13:
    Description of problem: Terminal read infinitely hanging because of not reading the keyboard buffer correctly
    Difficulty to find: Medium
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Technically only 127 charecters can be written to the keyboard buffer because 128 needs to be a 
              newline, so I changed the threshold for stopping writes to the buffer to 127 instead of 128

Bug 14:
    Description of problem: RTC read failed to wait, due to improper signaling variable used
    Difficulty to find: Easy
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Forgot to use extern in order to make variable from one file connect to another

Bug 15:
    Description of problem: RTC read failed to wait, due to improper signaling variable used
    Difficulty to find: Easy
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Forgot to use extern in order to make variable from one file connect to another

Bug 16:
    Description of problem: Keyboard would not perform the backspace action when the buffer was full
    Difficulty to find: Easy
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Took the backspace key check out of the if check for buffer not being full

Bug 17:
    Description of problem: Directory read failed
    Difficulty to find: Medium
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: We were printing more files than we had, so there were a number of spaces. We end the directory read when the buffer comes to be 0.

Bug 18:
    Description of problem: General protection fault when trying to run a second program
    Difficulty to find: Hard
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Flush TSS

Bug 19:
    Description of problem: Page fault when trying to execute programs
    Difficulty to find: Hard
    Difficulty to fix: Medium
    Solution: Argument was pointing to garbage, so fix changing page directory to be dynamic

Bug 20:
    Description of problem: Page fault when trying to execute programs
    Difficulty to find: Easy
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Flush TLB

Bug 21:
    Description of problem: Only printing first character of row when calling fish
    Difficulty to find: Hard
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Wasn't accounting for reading segments of a file so returning incorrect values

Bug 22:
    Description of problem: Incorrect address for screen_start
    Difficulty to find: Easy
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: pointed to the physical memory at 0xb8000 instead of the program image base

Bug 23:
    Description: Page Fault with Grep
    Difficulty to find: Medium
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: changed our param validation so we could read file data less than 1024 bytes

Bug 24:
    Description: Cat and Grep page fault with verylargefilewithverylongname.tx
    Difficulty to find: Easy
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Truncated so that we only care about the first 32 bits of file

Bug 25:
    Description: any command with verylargefilewithverylongname made it so fish was covered up
    Difficulty to find: Easy
    Difficulty to fix: Hard(not capable?)
    Solution: Something to do with how the fish function works so just do fish first

Bug 26:
    Description: get_args wasn't working with space before command
    Difficulty to find: Easy
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: altered our loop through the buffer to account for space before

BUG 27:
    Description: screen could not be cleared when keyboard buffer was full
    Difficulty to find: Easy
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Move the clear case in the keyboard handler outside of the buffer full check

BUG 28:
    Description: charecters were not being written to the correct temrinals video location
    Difficulty to find: Hard
    Difficulty to fix: Hard
    Solution: have putc take a tid so that it can be specified which terminal should be written to

BUG 29:
    Description: Switching between terminals was not working
    Difficulty to find: Hard
    Difficulty to fix: Incredibly easy
    Solution: missing parenthesis in an equation caused the esp to not be set correctly

BUG 30:
    Description: clearing the screen wrote a charecter to the screen that was not in the buffer
    Difficulty to find:
    Difficulty to fix:
    Solution: putc based on the charecter count rather than puts

BUG 31:
    Description: RTC was being slow when multiple program were using it at the same time
    Difficulty to find: Medium
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Virtualize the RTC to work with multiple processes and have multiple different rates

BUG 32:
    Description: Fish would try to write to the screen thorugh vidmap but the charecter would not appear
    Difficulty to find:
    Difficulty to fix:
    Solution: Fish can only write to memory location that do not hold NULL and thus, video memory must be initialized to
              be filled with space charecters rather than NULL charecters

BUG 33:
    Description: Switching shown terminal copied the wrong memory
    Difficulty to find: put
    Difficulty to fix:
    Solution: Instead of copying from kernel video memory, copy from the user level page

BUG 34:
    Description: Putc always wrote to the shown terminal instead of only writing to the shown if it is actually shown
    Difficulty to find: Medium
    Difficulty to fix: Easy
    Solution: Changed putc to write to video maps per terminal rather than physical video

BUG 35:
    Description: Process switching not work on multiterm
    Difficulty to find:
    Difficulty to fix:
    Solution: Needed to use curr_tid rather than tid
